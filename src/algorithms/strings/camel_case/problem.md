# CamelCase

Alice wrote a sequence of words in [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) as a string of letters, `s`, having the following properties:

- It is a concatenation of one or more _words_ consisting of English letters.
- All letters in the first word are _lowercase_.
- For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is _uppercase_ and rest of the letters are _lowercase_.

Given `s`, print the number of words in `s` on a new line.

### Input Format

A single line containing string `s`.

### Constraints

- `1 <= |s| <= 10^5`

### Output Format

Print the number of words in string `s`.

### Sample Input

    saveChangesInTheEditor

### Sample Output

    5

### Explanation

String `s` contains five words:

1. save
2. Changes
3. In
4. The
5. Editor

Thus, we print `5` on a new line.
